- Accent color: Lavender (#E6E6FA) as an analogous contrast to electric blue to highlight interactive elements.
- Font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font, is used for both headings and body text because its clean, modern look is highly suitable for chat apps.

- Smooth transitions using Framer Motion for page transitions, message bubbles, and the typing indicator.
- Use minimalist, line-based icons for a modern aesthetic.
